# Programming Language Fundamentals in Agda

This includes a few of the modules from my most recent pass of PLFA. On one of my previous passes I worked through more of the material but can't seem to find the folder on my computer. These implementations, as far as I'm aware, will be carbon copies from the book that I copied over while learning Agda.
