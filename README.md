# thoerem-proving-portfolio

Hello Favonia, Jonathan, Carlo, Matthew and Friends!

I've included in this repo a variety of projects and practice files that I've produced over the last few years while getting experience with theorem provers. Below is a synopsis and explanation of each of the folders. As far as I'm aware, all of the projects use an older version of the Agda standard library(!!!FILL THIS IN!!! version A.B.C). However, I believe it should still work with the newer versions. Please let me know if this is not the case and I can update the imports to work properly. 

Thanks for opportunity! I'm looking forward to hearing back!

Jack Martin
